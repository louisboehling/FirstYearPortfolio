            <p>Our team designed a new system for Petco’s WholeHearted food by recycling existing pet food
                    bags into a “Let’s Eat” product line and eliminating the need for future bags by creating a zero-
                    waste way of distributing WholeHearted food.</p>

                                dispensers would be placed on the wall. <b>Food is dispensed using the application interface on the
                                        screen that is attached to the tube into a container.</b></P>
                        <P>Petco will offer a line of rolling containers also made of
                                polypropylene. These containers are designed with a lip on the front that will allow them to clip
                                into the dispensing tubes. The food is dispensed straight into the container so customers never
                                have to interface with the food.</P>

                <P>
                        Our first round of brainstorming included making pet food
                        packaging into building materials for developing countries or for dog parks. But after thinking
                        through this, <b>we decided the solution should be something more easily incorporated into the
                                existing cycle.</b>
                        
                </P>
                <br>
                <P>
                        We needed to narrow down our thinking for solutions. We decided to focus on Petco because it’s
                        the second top pet retailer in the USA and it has an existing rewards program that can be used to
                        incentivize consumers to be a part of our solutions. <b>Petco is also open to innovation.</b> It is already
                        experimenting with new ways to dispense kitty litter and treats.
                        
                </P>
                <br>
                <P>
                        Our first testable solution went BIG! It was all about a entirely new and complicated pressurized
                        distribution system built into a room at Petco that can serve up any pet food on demand via a user
                        interface. Pet owners would use a bin made out of polypropylene to use the system.
                </P>
                <br>
                <P>
                        We quickly realized this was too expensive and complicated. How would Petco pay for this? Why
                        would pet food brands want to be a part of this? We then narrowed our thinking down to <b>Petco’s
                                own WholeHearted food line.</b> This let us experiment more with Petco’s rewards program and
                        existing pet food systems.
