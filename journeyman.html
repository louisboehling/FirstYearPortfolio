                <h4>Ideation Process</h4>
                <p>Our team recognized that most Americans who travel choose to do so in hopes of relaxing, exploring, and/or meeting new 
                    people to understand other lifestyles. However, people <i>rarely</i> travel to learn new skills.
                    </p> 
                <br>
                <h2>Initial Feedback</h2>
                <p>We were surprised after our first round of feedback from users.</p>
                
                <p>“I don’t know how I’d feel 
                    about staying with someone I just met while they teach me a skill. I use AirBnB to save money ...
                     not to spend all of my time with the host. But I like the idea of hands-on learning!” - Jeremy
                    </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Removing our Blinders</h2>
                <p>At first, this feedback was difficult to accept. Our team had crafted the idea from the fabric of personal experience. 
                    We knew first-hand the value of getting to know a host while learning new cultural perspectives. However, 
                    we quickly recognized that most Americans have not had these experiences, and our idea may not appeal to 
                    more introverted or hesitant travelers. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                <h2>Discovery 2.0</h2>
                <p>Thus, we shifted our focus to the education system, while still encouraging the exploration of new lifestyles,
                     but through the lens of education.  We wanted to build a system that would be mutually beneficial for
                      both students and teachers.
                    </p>
                    <p> We define experiential learning as a process through which students develop knowledge, 
                    skills, and values from direct experiences outside a traditional academic setting. </p>

            <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
            <P>Online platforms such as YouTube, Lynda.com, and Skillshare are affordable options for people who want to learn 
                new skills, but these companies are limited in what they can teach and fail to deliver the in person learning 
                experience that students value. 
                <p>The analysis helped us find the need in the market for an accessible lifelong 
                learning program that places value on a strong student-teacher relationships.</p>

                <p>The design of the website was meant to convey trust and authenticity to the user. The mixture of 
                    handwritten text with serif and sans serif fonts was purposeful in that the pairing of those 
                    fonts evokes a sense of beginning and learning, yet also a sense of value and structure as 
                    well. In that same essence, the colors we chose for the website are more subdued, scholarly,
                     and welcoming. The handdrawn elements are a way to bring in a sense of authenticity and a 
                     more educational look to the overall design of the site. </p>

                <P>
                        Our team was originally assigned different roles (strategy, UI/UX, and art direction) 
                        however we really found that we all started to take on each of these roles in our own
                         way. I was originally assigned UI/UX, however the art director and I fleshed out a 
                         vision we had so throughly that it was not apparent where her role stopped and mine 
                         began. She also took on UI/UX work. 
                </p>        
                <p>
                        This project was a testament to the idea that “stay in your lane mentality” is not 
                        always the best case in this kind of creative work. While we were respectful of each 
                        other’s roles, we found that we arrived at the best work and most thorough product 
                        when our inputs and ideas crossed those boundaries. 
                        
                </p>
                 <P>       
                        Over all, my role in the project was predominately in UI/UX work, art direction, 
                        and concept development.
